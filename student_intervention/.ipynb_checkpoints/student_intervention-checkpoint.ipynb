In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the problem setting, I choose the classification methods based on these following considerations: \n",
    "- there are both categorical and numerical features\n",
    "- the training data size is small, but there are many features.\n",
    "- the features are not necessarily linear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these considerations, I can quickly rule out some of the methods and the reasons are following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gaussian Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) generate some statistical probabilities based on the training data and use them as the prior knowledge for inference. It will generalize poorly when there are situations which GaussianNB hasn't seen before in the training data. Given that there are over 40 features but only 300 training data points, I expect GaussianNB is likely to run into such problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is a beautiful and straightford classification method, and since we are sloving a binary classification problem, basically we know we can set K equals to 2. However, KNN is essentially a **Lazy learner**, and it doesn't learn during training time. In this problem, we want to develop an algorithm which can generalize well and provides insights for future students, therefore KNN is not a good choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC) has been successfully applied to large-scale and sparse machine learning problems often encountered in text classification and natural language processing. It can be very efficient when dealing with large number (>10^5) of sparse training examples. However, although it's an efficient algorithm, SGD requires a number of hyperparameters such as the regularization parameter and the number of iterations, and is sensitive to feature scaling. Given that the size of the data is small and the danger of overfitting, SGD is probably an overkill and the tuning of hyperparameters are likely to complicates things unnecessarily in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are left with choices from Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression. Since Ensemble Methods are built upon decision tree and are more robustness compared to decision tree, I therefore choose Ensemble Methods, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Logistic Regression. Below is a discussion on the strength/weakness/industrial applications of these three algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Logistic Regression ***\n",
    "\n",
    "1) real-world application in industry:\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression has been shown useful in the area of:\n",
    " - Geographic Image Processing, for example creating a landslide susceptibility mapping. [1]\n",
    " - Image Segmentation and Categorization. [2]\n",
    " - Widely used in the healthcare industry\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) strengths and when it performs well:\n",
    "- Outputs have a nice probabilistic interpretation\n",
    "- Robustness: the independent variables don’t have to be normally distributed, or have equal variance\n",
    "- Works well for linearly separatable features\n",
    "- Requires less theoretical assumptions than discriminant analysis\n",
    "- Online learning: One can easily update the model to take in new data the future， LR allows new data to quickly incorporate into the model.\n",
    "- Many ways to regularize the model to tolerate some errors and avoid over-fitting\n",
    "\n",
    "3) weakness and when it performs poorly:\n",
    "- LR tends to underperform when there are non-linear decision boundaries\n",
    "- LR requires observations to be independent of one another, but if there are not properly identified, LR provides little predictive value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Ensemble Methods, specifically Gradient Boosting ***\n",
    "\n",
    "1) real-world application in industry:\n",
    "- GB is an ensemble learning method for improvingthe predictive performance of classification or regression procedures, such as decision trees. Gradient boosting has been shown useful in various Binary classification, Multiclass classification and Regression tasks. \n",
    "- In fact, a numerical of winning solutions for Kaggle's competitions are somewhat related to a popular Gradient Boosting algorithm called XGBoost.  For example, one industrial application is the recommendation system for ecommerce and many websites, and GB is the winning algorithm in a recent competition on collaborative filtering (CF). [3] \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) strengths and when it performs well: \n",
    "- GB models are simple to understand and interpret like decision trees. People are able to understand decision tree models after a brief explanation.\n",
    "- GB models can automatically select variables, \n",
    "- GB models are robust to outliers, missing data and numerous correlated and irrelevant variables,\n",
    "- GB can construct variable importance in exactly the same way as random forest.\n",
    "- Some of the successful GB algorithms such as XGBoost are sparse-aware and can effectively handle data sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) weakness and when it performs poorly: \n",
    "- while GB has many advantages especially in handingly tabulated datasets, it is a lot less famous in the area of computer vision and speech/language applications, where convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have demonstrated great success. \n",
    "- GB may experience the same issue as decision tree in terms of local maxima. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*** SVM ***\n",
    "\n",
    "1) real-world application in industry: [4]\n",
    "- text and hypertext categorization\n",
    "- Classification of images\n",
    "- Hand-written characters can be recognized using SVM\n",
    "- The SVM algorithm has been widely applied in the biological and other sciences. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) strengths and when it performs well:\n",
    "- Kernel trick: efficient for dealing with high dimensional feature space. One can build in expert knowledge about the problem via engineering the kernel. \n",
    "- SVM is defined by a convex optimisation problem (no local minima) for which there are efficient methods (dual representation). \n",
    "- SVM have regularization parameters to tolerate some errors and avoid over-fitting\n",
    "- Provides a good out-of-sample generalization, if the parameters C and gamma are appropriate chosen. In other words, SVM might be more robust even when the training sample has some bias\n",
    "\n",
    "3) weakness and when it performs poorly:\n",
    "- Bad interpretability: SVMs are black boxes\n",
    "- High computational cost: SVMs scale exponentially in training time\n",
    "- Users might need to have certain domain knowledge to use kernel function\n",

    "Based on the training/test time, as well as the test F1 score, I choose SVM as the best model for the data for the following reasons. Given that logistic regression is essentially a linear model, and there is no guarantee that the features are linearly separatable, it's not surprising that SVM with a non-linear kernel may better represent the model better than logistic regression. As to the gradient boosting classifier, it looks like the untuned model has achieved a very high training F1 score but performs much worse during test time. As gradient boosting classifier can easily lead to overfitting, I interpret the huge training and testing F1 score different as largely due to overfitting and the small training sample size.  \n",

    "In terms of the training/testing time, gradient boosting is the most computationally costly, while LR and SVM are computationally fast on roughly the same scale. Although LR is slightly faster, both LR and SVM are rather fast given the data size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of the available data, I wouldn't expect the data size to increase dramatically in the future, since the school probably evaluates students only a few times a year so the available data size won't increase dramatically. As gradient boosting seems to overfit and may require more data (or regularization), I think SVM is a good choice again given the size of the availabel data. "

    "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a type of linear separator. Suppose we want to split green circles from the blue ones above by drawing a line. Notice that there are an infinite number of lines that will accomplish this task. SVMs, in particular, find the **\"maximum-margin\"** line - this is the line \"in the middle\". In other words, SVM finds a line which has the largest overall distance (called \"margin\") to the points on each size. Intuitively, the max margin works well because it has the largest tolerance for noise and mistakes on either side.  \n",
    "![title](max_margin.png)\n",
    "Note that the example illustrated here is shown in a 2D plane, and in real cases the dots are located in a high dimensional space, so the max-margin line we draw here becomes a hyper plane, but you get the idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vectors**: Once we understand the concept of maximizing the margin, we can immediately see that the margin lines are only determined by a subset of dots that are close to the margin lines, while the data points that are away from the margin lines have no influence on the outcome whatsoever. This subset of points are called \"Support vectors\".  \n",
    "![title](support_vectors.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that SVM is versatile and can be used for **both classification and regression**. When we want to separate the dots for classification, we want to maximize the margin. But when we want to predict a trend line following the dots (regression), we want to find the minimum distance between two margin lines which include as many data points in between as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hard and soft margin**: We may notice from the above figures that if we were to require a perfectly separation between the green and blue dots (we call this \"hard margin\"), the margin lines will be very sensitive to any noisy points that lie in between, and in some cases it's even not possible to perfectly separate the green and blue points.  However, if we allow some errors/misclassifications in how the margin lines separate the dots, we can avoid the case where a single outlier totally distors the margin lines (we call this \"soft margin\"). By using a soft margin, we can essentially avoid overfitting to noisy points and achieve a more generalized model to fit the unseen data. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Kernel trick**. We may come across a problem where the datapoints are not linearly separatable in their original space, for example in the case shown below. [1] If we project the data points from their original space to a higher dimension that represents the square of distance of each point to the origin, we can see that the data points are totally separatable as their distance to the origin are dinstinctively different. Simply put, the way we transform the original feature space to a higher dimensional space is call \"kernel trick\". It adds non-linearity to the feature space based on our domain knowledge, and allows SVM to classify data points that are not linearly separatable.  \n",
